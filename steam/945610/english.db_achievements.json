Yet, defiant as ever, Nimelle hugged her best friend, held her tears inside, and calmly levitated high above everyone else. She took a deep breath, and saved us with the humblest of spells ; a Drain from her left hand absorbed half of the shockwave from M' Or's energy, and she redirected that to her right hand, chanelling a super,charged Shield to block the rest. Despite the success of her insane plan, the pain of having M' Or's energy course through her body must have been beyond excruciating, because all of us still hear her screams ; and as a testament, we renamed the summit of this mountain accordingly.

The closer they got to the tundra, the harder it became to reach it, and many died in this migration ; yet a few finally reached a secluded mansion in the middle of this icy garden.

    "description": "Currently Amyra is favored by enough citizens to ensure stability, and her policy of welcoming outsiders, is widely respected. This mentality has attracted Tradesmen, Scientists, Artists and Chefs from all around Delasphos, to the Resistance's capital. The Tradesman's guild mainly wants to keep the peace, yet it is known to strong arm the other Factions, especially when it comes to basic resources produced by the Resistance's vast agriculture practice. Of course, they do it all within the extent of the law. The Guild of Arcane Arts has great prestige due to their study of Delasphos's elemental imbalance, and along with the Inventor's Guild their official mission is to make life better for everyone on this planet; but every coin has a flip side. Regardless, they steer away from politics. Besides the functional, the Resistance has a knack for the aesthetical as well. The Guild of Expression is known for nurturing an individual's latent talents, which becomes apparent during the many festivals that happen within the cities and villages. In most of these, commoners get a chance to taste what is considered the most divine food of the Realm ; normally affordable only by the privileged few. This culmination of guilds, is born and gives rise to the multi,cultural environment Amyra always envisioned.",

    "description": "Right after the portal closed, energy storms ravaged the skies. Thousands of birds and dragons felt their very souls being sucked clean out of their bodies.  While the Storm of Souls raged, ever so often a dragon or eagle soul would gather all of its strength and bolt its way down to the surface, desperate to find another host. Many monstrosities were born that night and many died instantly. Yet, the next morning marked the birth of the first Dragonborn and Araakokras. Dragon and eagle souls, fused with potent human bodies in perfect sync. No longer able to fly, they took shelter in the forest, and as they grew, they realized they could now think; they could hypothesize, and deduce, they could plan ahead. They took over the forest, and vowed to destroy those who would seek to further upset the fauna and flora of this planet. They became Evolution's Assault, and as a Faction they were present in both negotiation attempts. Since the Clover Treaty, they started bartering in raw materials, and most of the wood and stone that was used in building Clover came from them. They are also experts when it comes to matters of wildlife and weather, and their help has been critical to anticipating and preventing damage from torrential storms.",

    "description": "With nature's wisdom and love for peace as well as their ability to survive in harsh circumstances, the citizen's of Nature's assault found refuge in the abandoned mountain cities and claimed them for themselves. They have a council that is selected through voting and that decides for their course of action. They despise death yet they want their security. Although the council decides important issues, everyone is at liberty to create and manage a town so there are many clans, some of them rather influential. The Res R' Cher clan focuses on studying nature in attempts to control the wild weather for the faction's benefit. Their connection with the forest is second to none. Equally strong, for different reasons, The Hut Ur Khul are rather aggressive , a bit outcasted yet respected by the rest of the clans, they revere the Faction's propsperity above all and are often seen as the shield of the forest.",

    "description": "Most Factions' Tribes are mismatched, but few hate each other as much as those of the Elven Pact. High Elves and Dark Elves, as well as some Half,Elves that were born during the war, make up for most of its citizens. As soon as the portals were open, the elves were prepared. They cast aside their differences, at least temprorarily, and rushed as two separate armies with one common goal; to conquer the world at the other side. And they would have, had the portalled remained open long enough for their entire armies to make it through. They have declared their twin capital cities to be Inl Thenmar and Onf Thenmar, an old human city, split in two. There's also rumors of Wood Elves that made it through the portal, but no one has seen any in the last 50 years. No matter how hard they tried, after the imminent threat disappeared and the Clover Treaty was signed, they could no longer unite under mixed leadership. So they now share a city split in half, and each Tribe abides to their own leaders and laws",

    "description": "Despite their differences, the Elves share a common leadership structure; a High Priest, followed by a Council of the Tribe's wisest. Each council meets behind closed doors regarding most issues. Internally, decisions are made by the noble families who are still influential and whose bloodlines go back to before the storm of souls. During times of war, martial law is enforced, and both councils are replaced by the Council of the Seven Blades; a joint military council tasked with assuring the faction's dominance. It's not uncommon to launch provocative or under,cover missions against other Factions, but evidence of this is hard to come by ; still, everyone knows and this has fueled the distrust towards the Elven Pact. As a result, emotions of the citizens are split; some believe it necessary, others see it as an obstacle to long,term peace. What's certain is that Inl and Onf Thenmar are not very often visited by other Factions.",

    "description": "Every Faction abides to the Clover Treaty; a set of rules that take precedence above all else. But, the Elven Pact is a Faction which besides external struggles, suffers great internal tension as well.Two Tribes that have hated eachother for centuries, have now been forced by circumstances to share a city, and they've so far managed it without a civil war breaking out. This is thanks to a 3,tiered set of rules; Elven Laws, Divine Commands and Council Orders. Elven Laws revolve around peace,keeping between elves.Steal, lose a hand.Attack lose an arm. Kill, lose a head.This is enforced by the Capital Guard ; a military force who is bound by powerful oaths to both High Elvish and Dark Elvish gods to uphold these laws, oaths sealed by the Priests of each Pantheon. Divine Commands are who believe in them, and are offered as a guide to avoid divine punishment. Still, openly disrespecting a religion will get you face to face with the respective High Priest to decide your fate. Council Orders can only be refuse if the receiver believes they contradict the Clover Treaty, Elven Laws or their Tribe's Divine Commands. The Capital Guard or the appropriate High Priest judges the grounds for their disobedience and acts accordingly. This tight system of Laws makes most of Delasphos's inhabitants feel unwelcome at Inl and Onf Thenmar, and only visit if they have business with the Elven Pact.",

Bravely, we hoped against all hope, as there was so much at stake. Our very freedom was up against the ropes. The crowd understood that it was not Dark versus High, just Elf against Elf. And that neither of our nations could stand alone.' Verses by Thaduin, a survivor that witnessed the Truce between Dark and High Elves, the two Tribes that make up the Elven Pact.

Despite Delasphos undergoing torrential blizzards, thunderstorms and volcanic explosions, both Tribes were smiling with relief. No matter how slim, they finally had a chance at survival. Deep inside the caves of the Laughing Peak, they found a place to call home.It sheltered them, and brought them together ; yet something was wrong in the very air.Both Tribes' youngs would start behaving aggressively, as if being posessed. It wasn't long before the elders started hearing them too. 'Destroy'. 'Burn'. 'Kill'. 'Die'. Dark voices would echo in their minds. Only the eldest managed to escape, and made their way south, to the Cihr Mountains. Everyone else succumbed to the dark influence, and with a flame of destruction in their eyes, they ravaged the lands. Villages were burned, women raped and men killed.It took a thirty years of mining and researching the Core of Cihr Mountains for the elders to find a way to weaken the Dark One, and free their youths. A way that cost them their lives. Since then, the lack of all,out aggression from them has allowed for trade routes to be established, especially after being present in the Clover Treaty.Minerals and Gems are flowing outwards, with the cults controlling the distribution, and the Elders providing the supply. Despite that, the rest of the world never forgot their attrocities, and the faction's name of Devil's Seeds has stuck with them.",

    "description": "For three decades most Orcs and Dwarves were under the influence of the Dark Voice.Then, the voices suddenly stopped ; the Elders had sacrificed themselves to free them of the Dark One's influence. The Tribesmen felt..lost.All their life they had relied on their Elders for guidance, and ever since they came to Delasphos, the Voice had directed them on what to do. That's when those who claimed they could still hear the Voice started appearing, and Cults were born. These Cults are known for blind obedience to their Leader, whom they revere, since she, or he, are their only link to the Voice, which is a shared affinity between the different Cults.Even though, each leader interprets the Voice differently, they all claim it grants them demonic powers. There are many Cults, especially in the small villages spread on the footholds of the Laughing Peak.Some have a handful of people led by someone who was charismatic enough to convince them he hears voices, without having any demonic powers. Others can be large enough to spread throughout the northern slopes of the Cihr Mountains and might even have sworn cultists within the major cities. But as we approach the capital, there is only one cult; the cult of Tharizdun. Leading this cult is Morthos, a powerful orc sorcerer with demonic body parts resembling the great old one his cult reveres. Although he doesn't treat his people harshly, no one dares question his ruling. Those who aren't fond of the status quo of the Devil's Seeds' capital tend to leave, which has turned Ord Vuzdur into the cult's headquarters.",
