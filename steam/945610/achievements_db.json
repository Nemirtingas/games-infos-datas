The closest planets, detonated instantly. On Delasphos, terraforming began. The earth split in half, mountains emerged out of nowhere, lakes started spiraling upwards into the air, mountains turned into volcanoes and in certain places time stood still.All 3 Arch Sorcerers were present ; and they agreed on one thing; we were all doomed. Yet, defiant as ever, Nimelle hugged her best friend, held her tears inside, and calmly levitated high above everyone else. She took a deep breath, and saved us with the humblest of spells ; a Drain from her left hand absorbed half of the shockwave from M' Or's energy, and she redirected that to her right hand, chanelling a super,charged Shield to block the rest. Despite the success of her insane plan, the pain of having M' Or's energy course through her body must have been beyond excruciating, because all of us still hear her screams ; and as a testament, we renamed the summit of this mountain accordingly.

The planet's soil was not the only thing that suffered from the exposure to the soul energy. Many of the forest's animal's , wolves and lizards, birds and dragons, absorbed great amounts of soul energy. Some died instantly while others mutated over the next two decades, giving rise to entirely new species which battled for supremacy in the forests. Aaracocras and Dragonborns were the victors, if one can describe mass extinction as a victory.

Only the eldest managed to escape, and made their way south, to the Cihr Mountains. Everyone else succumbed to the dark influence, and with a flame of destruction in their eyes, they ravaged the lands. Villages were burned, women raped and men killed.It took a thirty years of mining and researching the Core of Cihr Mountains for the elders to find a way to weaken the Dark One, and free their youths. A way that cost them their lives. Since then, the lack of all,out aggression from them has allowed for trade routes to be established, especially after being present in the Clover Treaty.Minerals and Gems are flowing outwards, with the cults controlling the distribution, and the Elders providing the supply. Despite that, the rest of the world never forgot their attrocities, and the faction's name of Devil's Seeds has stuck with them.",

      "english": "For three decades most Orcs and Dwarves were under the influence of the Dark Voice.Then, the voices suddenly stopped ; the Elders had sacrificed themselves to free them of the Dark One's influence. The Tribesmen felt..lost.All their life they had relied on their Elders for guidance, and ever since they came to Delasphos, the Voice had directed them on what to do. That's when those who claimed they could still hear the Voice started appearing, and Cults were born. These Cults are known for blind obedience to their Leader, whom they revere, since she, or he, are their only link to the Voice, which is a shared affinity between the different Cults.Even though, each leader interprets the Voice differently, they all claim it grants them demonic powers. There are many Cults, especially in the small villages spread on the footholds of the Laughing Peak.Some have a handful of people led by someone who was charismatic enough to convince them he hears voices, without having any demonic powers. Others can be large enough to spread throughout the northern slopes of the Cihr Mountains and might even have sworn cultists within the major cities. But as we approach the capital, there is only one cult; the cult of Tharizdun. Leading this cult is Morthos, a powerful orc sorcerer with demonic body parts resembling the great old one his cult reveres. Although he doesn't treat his people harshly, no one dares question his ruling. Those who aren't fond of the status quo of the Devil's Seeds' capital tend to leave, which has turned Ord Vuzdur into the cult's headquarters.",
