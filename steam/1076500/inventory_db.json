    "description": "The wiles of the gods were well known throughout Greece. The games they played, their tricks, their jealousy. But even a god could push his luck too far and earn the punishment of his peers. Such was the case of Ares, cast out for one too many slights against his brothers and sisters.\n\nWhen he fell to earth, it was not as a god, but a child. Stripped of his divinity and placed in the care of Phillip II, King of Macedonia, Ares was given the name Alexander and lived the life of a young man of royalty. He learned of life as a human, studying the scepter as well as the sword. Though while he took in the lessons of man, he never forgot his true origins. When Phillip II died, the twenty year old Alexander ascended the throne to rule over Macedonia. As he took up the crown of his adopted father’s kingdom, he made a promise to himself. A promise to regain his godhood. To make the whole of the world worship at the foot of his throne.\n\nAlexander remembered the taste of divinity. He set out to conquer the whole of the world for his strength had always come from battle. He led his warriors with pitiless ferocity, bringing war to every tribe and nation. From the devotion and loyalty of his soldiers, a drop of the power he had once held as a god returned to him. And he needed more. So his conquering continued, all throughout the mediterranean and east into Asia. As more and more peoples were enveloped into his empire, Alexander’s power grew, bit by bit. But it was never enough. His thirst for divinity drove him onward, his grasp reaching further and further into the world. Ever-expanding war for his ever-growing power. For as he promised to himself, he would not stop until every man, woman, and child of the world worshipped at the foot of Alexander the Great.",

    "description": "An only child and the daughter of King Uther Pendragon, Arthur was born into the life of a princess. The only heir to the crown, her fate was to serve as a docile Queen. But Arthur was no weak maid in need of protecting. And though her father did not believe his daughter strong enough to wear the crown, Arthur set out to prove her strength. While she was still just a girl, Arthur took up the sword of a knight and sought out the monsters of Britain’s forests to prove her strength to her father.\n\nArthur heeded every call for help, every bounty placed, and every rumor of terrifying monster she came across. And with every passing season her strength grew and her renown along with it. Other knights and hunters of beasts began to follow in Arthur’s footsteps, eager to fight alongside her. Piling high the many trophies of their hunts on a large table in Camelot for all to see, the people of Britain far and wide knew the name of Arthur and her Knights of the Round Table.\n\nAs the tales of her valor grew ever more numerous, Uther called his daughter home to court. Arthur knelt before the throne of Britain and Uther beseeched his daughter to return to his side. But Arthur refused, declaring she would not return again to court until she had proven to Uther and his subjects that her strength was great enough to lead. Uther blessed her then and there with his own sword, declaring Arthur his successor and heir, to rule in his place when he should pass. But Arthur did not return to his side. She returned instead to her Knights of the Round Table and continued their hunt to purge Britain of the vile monsters which plagued it. Witches and giants and great serpents did they hunt, bringing safety to the people of Britain. But no victory was proof enough to herself that she was worthy of her father’s crown.\n\nYears passed by and eventually word of the King’s passing came to Camelot. Arthur returned to her father’s castle and mourned over him. But no sooner had she wept over his grave that the people called out for the crowning of their new King. And so Arthur reluctantly took up her father’s crown as King and ascended to the throne, to defend her kingdom and its people against any threat to Britain, natural or otherwise.",

Shortly after her husband’s death, with a handful of modest fleets roaming the seas, life for the pirates of the South China Sea grew perilous. The Chinese navy and Portuguese trading fleets sailed freely through their waters, crushing what pirates were fool enough to fight back against the encroachment of civilization. With only a small fleet of junks to her name, Cheng I Sao vowed to protect the lives of her pirate brothers and sisters at all costs. But instead of taking her fleet to the Chinese navy, she took it into the heart of the maelstrom, where the serpents slept.\n\nCheng I Sao found where the home of the great serpents of the South China Sea, a place deep in the heart of the wind and waves, a place no sane sailor would choose to go. Undaunted, she caught and chained one of the great serpents, binding it to the promise of obeying her will if it wished to be released. The serpent agreed. With the great monster under her command, Cheng I Sao returned to shallower waters and set her sights on her enemies. Wielding the power of the mighty serpent, she swept through the Chinese navy. Fleet after enemy fleet, she freed the waters of the South China Sea of the shackles of civilization and returned them to their rightful rulers. The pirates.",

Very few would ever get the chance, however, and none who did would succeed.\n\nWhen Erik Thorvaldson fled his homeland, he brought with him the accumulated wealth of a dozen viking kings. His ship sailed low in the water, laden down with baskets of jewels, barrels of gold, and every other kind of holy or valuable trinket Erik was able to get his hands on. But soon his ship became known throughout the many viking halls and harbors dotting the northern seas. With nowhere else to turn, Erik sailed west, finally coming to the frozen wastes of Greenland.\n\nOnce ashore, he endeavoured to hide his vast treasures deep in the mountains. He built a holdfast among the snowy peaks where his wealth would be safe, away from the roving bands of vikings searching for him. But he would not remain hidden for long. Soon, the location of Erik’s holdfast was discovered and word spread from ship to ship like the wind. Word of the fabled treasures of Erik the Red and where they were kept. And so they came. Ships sailed for Greenland, carrying on them eager young men thirsting for the glory and wealth that came with slaying Erik the Red. The vikings scrambled over each other to be the first to defeat him. But Erik remained. He would not leave his vast treasure behind. His axe would be the death of any who would try to take it.

Hardly a man himself and with no warriors of his own by his side, Temujin turned to desperate measures.

With his new gifts, he slew his father’s killers with brutality and finality, ending the attack. Though his family was safe, the blood in his veins never cooled, for the horse gods’ vengeance had not yet been sated. He rallied to his side what few warriors he could trust and together they again begged blessings from the horse god, drinking of the horse’s blood and offering their very souls in exchange for vengeance.\n\nTemujin took on the title of Genghis Khan, leading his warriors into a battle against the tribes who betrayed him. One after another, he conquered the other tribes of the Asian Steppe.

But for all her normalcy, an uncanny thing happened to people when Jeanne was around. They were better. Their work easier, their woes faded and their joys swelled. Word of Jeanne’s influence spread until one day it came to the ears of the uncrowned King Charles VII of France, beset upon all sides by the threat of the English.\n\nThe King sent for Jeanne, bidding her come to the besieged city of Orleans and lift the spirits of the soldiers and people there. Jeanne obeyed, travelling far from her tiny village to the great, besieged city. When she arrived, however, Jeanne found herself overwhelmed by the state of the people. The sight of her French brothers and sisters broken and destitute brought her to her knees and she wept.\n\nNo sooner had she wiped away her tears, though, that she took up the standard of her King and stepped out the front gates, facing the fields of English. Throughout the city, a wave of courage swept through the people. Soldiers picked up their shields and spears, wounds closing and new strength coursing through their bodies as their empty bellies and souls filled. An army formed at the peasant girl’s back. With her standard high, Jeanne charged the enemy who oppressed the people of Orleans. As her cry went up, the army roared, fearlessly charging into the English with impossible vigor and incomparable strength. The French army swept the English from around the city of Orleans, breaking the six month siege. When the battle was over, Jeanne returned to the King, standard in hand. She declared she would not set it down until France was free from English rule. With the King’s blessing, Jeanne took to every front, leading her armies to free France from the chains of England.",

In defiance, these shapeshifting yokai took the forms of men and fled to the far reaches of Japan. The greater spirits were enraged by the yokai’s defiance and from their anger was born a boy, blessed with the speed of the wind and the steadiness of the earth itself. The boy was called Miyamoto Musashi. Raised by a priest named Dorinbo, the boy quickly grew skilled in the art of the sword, resolved to take up the spirits’ calling to hunt down and bring to heel the rogue yokai who roamed Japan.\n\nAt thirteen, Musashi encountered the first of these yokai, a brazen young man causing trouble in a nearby town. When he went to the young man, he saw the yokai for what it was and demanded it leave the mortal world in the name of the spirits. When the yokai refused and took its true shape, Musashi struck it down with his blade. Thus began his journey.\n\nSixty one duels Musashi won. And sixty one yokai he banished to the afterlife, exacting the greater spirits’ will as the divine sword of the kami. Until his power grew too strong. The kami soon feared that Musashi would turn his holy abilities on his masters. And so they came to Musashi and demanded he return the power they had gifted to him. But Musashi refused. He told the great kami that they would have to defeat him in a duel if they desired the power back. The kami, having watched Musashi slay sixty one yokai, retreated back into their rocks and streams, knowing they could not defeat him. Musashi continued to hone his skills, mastering the divine sword. He passed this knowledge onto his disciples and they too became warriors for even the greater spirits to fear. In this way, Miyamoto Musashi aided the passing of the world from kami to mankind in Japan, becoming the barrier that protected the mortal world from any yokai or kami that would see fit to do it harm.",

    "description": "Out of the small town of Stratford-upon-Avon, a young, ambitious boy dreamed of mastering the written word. Young William Shakespeare spent his childhood absorbed in writings and poetry and plays, consuming all he could and wanting nothing more than to be the greatest playwright and poet to ever live. But there was one problem. Young William was talentless. His words fell flat on the page and his prose were mocked by those who heard them. He could write nothing that would elicit a reaction beyond pity or scorn.\n\nDistraught and unsure of what to do with his lack of ability, William prayed. He begged his quill, page, and ink for the ability to write the greatest work of the stage ever written and to be lauded for his work. He declared he would pay any price, offering up his very soul as payment if need be. And the ink listened. The next day, when William put quill to parchment, the pact was sealed. His soul flowed out of him into the work, producing the greatest play ever written to date. And thus Henry VI was composed.\n\nBut soon his own soul was not enough. The ink promised him more if he would but offer up a greater price. The soul of another. Where Shakespeare’s soul had dried up, the empty space it left behind soon filled with an unquenchable thirst for power. A power only the ink could provide. A power he reached for with glee. And so Shakespeare began his dark work. Writing the souls of those around him onto the page, offering them as payment for the mastery he gained. And how his power grew. Soon his works were praised across the land, celebrated in every language, and cheered in every theater. He was the greatest playwright who ever lived. The Bard of Avon. A wizard of the written word.",

Thinking it a trick, the rebels raised their bows to strike him down with arrows, but Kǒng raised his hands and spoke to them. He told them of the path of righteousness, the rituals and traditions of Heaven, and the behaviors of the virtuous man. At the sound of his voice, the hearts of the rebels transformed and their bloodlust faded. Like a wave, the rebellion dissolved at Confucius’s words, dispersing back into the countryside. Kǒng returned to the city, having defeated the rebellion without raising a sword, and was given the name Confucius, Master Kong. With the city saved, Confucius bid the duke well and left with his disciples to travel the provinces and steer the hearts of man down the righteous path.",
