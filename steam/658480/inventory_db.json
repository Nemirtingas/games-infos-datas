Money is going here instead of websites or movies where women ruin their lives and lose their love and faith.\n\n#3 Respecting Boundaries: There's nothing in this package you wouldn't see on the beach on Io, Mars, or Earth today.\nStill, I must label this 18+ and mature though the title mature and adult is always ironic for stuff that's completely and udderly immature.\nFully clothed, exaggeratedly busty females of various alien species will replace the tame basic icons.\n\n#4 Reflective Philosophy: Why is it that society is accepting of every body type on television— all races, fat, thin, short, tall, strong, weak, able-bodied or not— but the thin busty lady is banned from being on TV? Starfighter General is here to challenge society's hypocrisy. We cancel the cancel culture.\n\n#5 Theme: Buying a copy of this package enhances the game's theme of 80's future wild west outlandishness.\n\nSome people want to roleplay an interstellar player often with machismo out of irony and parody. This BBA module allows this.\n\nBonus: You can buy more than one Beach Babe Alien Module.\n\nThe more Beach Babe Alien Modules you buy ===\n         === The higher probability of the more outlandish the alien babes.\n\nEnjoy Starfighter General, the most ambitious video game ever conceived. Purchasing virtual goods helps make the game faster for all! YAY!\n\nIn Space, no one hears you complain about back pain as much.\n\nSo it saves lives of women by taking money from bad guys and rescuing women. What's not to love?\n\nIt's like being a hero who rescues a princess from a bad guy in real life, except you're rescuing a woman who doesn't even know she's a princess, but has low self-esteem.  For once it's morally acceptable since no women are exploited and your purchase will help them escape the trap of self destruction.  Thank you.",
