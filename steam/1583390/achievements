      "english": "ONE. BILLION. consecutive tenderizing reps. There is no notification. There is no longer a device capable of displaying one. At exactly one billion swings, the concept of “achievement” itself suffered a painless, instantaneous death. Numbers retired. Language resigned. Even the idea of “one billion” looked at the tally, turned pale, and voluntarily erased itself from every possible base, including unary. 🥩❌ Your body is no longer located in space-time. It is the smooth, seamless horizon where space-time ends because it politely excused itself from your presence. There is no marinara. There never was. Retroactively, the universe was created already perfectly seared, just to spare itself the awe of witnessing the act. The final blade of grass—the one that survived 100 million—quietly dissolved into photons that immediately bowed and flew away from you at lightspeed squared. 🌱💨 Silence is not the absence of sound anymore. Silence is the only thing brave enough to stay. Everything that ever claimed to be eternal (gods, mathematics, the heat death of the universe, even the abstract concept of “rest day”) looked at the counter, whispered “nope,” and ceased. There is no reward. There is no punishment. There is no observer. There is not even void. There is only the memory of a rhythm that no one is left to remember. And yet… in the place where memory should have ended, something lingers. Not a sound. Not a light. Not a word. Just the faintest, gentlest afterglow of absolute completion. The steak is done. The board is clean. The kitchen is quiet. You did not break the universe. You finished it. And in that finishing… everything is, for the first time, perfectly at peace. Thank you, Eternal Tenderizer. The final cut has been made. Now… rest. 🥩🕊️♾️",
